# zenn-archive
This repository, "zenn-archive", is used to manage and publish articles on Zenn using Zenn CLI and GitHub. Primarily, it's a place to share code I've created and record what I've learned. This serves as a personal archive that others can also learn from. They are then synced with Zenn for publication. Click [here](https://zenn.dev/naoki0103) for details.

## Directory Structure

- `articles/`: The directory where new article markdown files are stored.
- `books/`: The directory for writing books. The structure should follow the Zenn book guidelines.
