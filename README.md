# zenn-archive
![](https://github.com/C-Naoki/zenn-archive/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)

This repository is used to manage and publish articles on [Zenn](https://zenn.dev/) and [Qiita](https://qiita.com/). Primarily, it's a place to share the code I've created and record what I've learned. This serves as a personal archive from which others can also learn. You can find my pages on Zenn [here](https://zenn.dev/naoki0103) and on Qiita [here](https://qiita.com/C-Naoki), respectively.
